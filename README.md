# ![bohne](http://k40s.net/download/bohne32.png) coffeepot

Server side application for [coffee](https://github.com/rfc2324/coffee)

## What is RFC2324?
[RFC2324](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt) is a facetious communications protocol for controlling a coffee pot. It's also called the [Hyper Text Coffe Pot Control Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol) (HTCPCP).

## What can coffee do?
coffee puts you in control of any compatible coffee pot/machine. Our first version will unfortunately only be able to control a modified version of Philips' [Senseo](http://www.amazon.de/Philips-60-Kaffeepadmaschine-Senseo-schwarz/dp/B0000BY5H0) coffee machine. But we hope will will get some more machines integrated too.

## I want to use it.
You can wait for a stable release (which will surely take a while) or just clone the repo and compile it. Also you can help by filing bugs and give us ideas for new features (but no GUI stuff!!). Or you can just submit some code. Any help is appreciated.
