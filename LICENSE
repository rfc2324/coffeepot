TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
  0. This license applies to any program or work which contains a
notice of the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms and conditions of the Kellagroup OS Software License (KOSSL).
The "program" or the "Software", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
work of it. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. "You" and "your" means
any person who would like to copy, distribute, share, use or modify the
Software. "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Software or making it
accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to
others outside of your company or organization. "Source" form means the source code,
documentation source, and configuration files for the Software.
 
  1. You can copy, share, edit, re-distribute and use the program in almost any
way you want. Exceptions are: commercial (re)sale, military, weapon research and 
manufacturing and similar.
 
  2. The Program and any work based on the Program must be provided free of charge
and either with the source code or with a notice where to get the code which
must be also free of charge. Distributing the Program or any work based on the
program on a physical media is allowed to be charged only if the charge is lower
or equal to the costs required to produce and obtain the media.
 
  3. Work which embeds or uses the software in any way must be provided either free
of charge or seperate from the stated work. Parts of the Source Code embedded into the
Source Code of another Work need to be accessible free of charge by anyone.
 
  4. Do not use, modify, share or distribute the Software or its source code, if you
do not accept this license.
 
  5. Disclaimer of warranty: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND
CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO
COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
